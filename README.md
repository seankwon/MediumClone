Medium Clone 
===================================

A fun little rails side project, created and nurtured by a curious love of rspec and rails api. Using this project in order to dip my toes in the following technologies.

The tech
=====================================

- Postgres
- Rspec, Capybara, Factory Girl, and (hopefully) other test software
- RAILS 4
- Javascript (hopefully some ajax requests or something.. idk.)
